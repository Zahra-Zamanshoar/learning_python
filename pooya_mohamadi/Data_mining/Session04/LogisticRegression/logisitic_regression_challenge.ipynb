    "## Logistic Regression\n",

    "### After completing materials of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain what logistic regression is, how it is used and the benefits of using it.\n",
    "* Recognize the necessary format for data in order to perform predictive logistic regression.\n",
    "* Develop a logistic regression data mining model using a training data set.\n",
    "* Interpret the model’s outputs and apply them to a scoring data set in order to deploy the model.\n",

    "#### ORGANIZATIONAL UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "    we are trying to determine what kinds of programs we should develop to help victims of heart attacks avoid suffering a recurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Age__: The age in years of the person, rounded to the nearest whole year.\n",
    "* __Marital_Status__: The person’s current marital status, indicated by a coded number: 0–Single, never married; 1–Married; 2–Divorced; 3–Widowed.\n",
    "* __Gender__: The person’s gender: 0 for female; 1 for male.\n",
    "* __Weight_Category__: The person’s weight categorized into one of three levels: 0 for normal weight range; 1 for overweight; and 2 for obese.\n",
    "* __Cholesterol__: The person’s cholesterol level, as recorded at the time of their treatment for their most recent heart attack (their only heart attack, in the case of those individuals in the scoring data set.)\n",
    "* __Stress_Management__: A binary attribute indicating whether or not the person has previously attended a stress management course: 0 for no; 1 for yes.\n",
    "* __Trait_Anxiety__: A score on a scale of 0 to 100 measuring the level of each person’s natural stress levels and abilities to cope with stress. A short time after each person in each of the two data sets had recovered from their first heart attack, they were administered a standard test of natural anxiety. Their scores are tabulated and recorded in this attribute along five point increments. A score of 0 would indicate that the person never feels anxiety, pressure or stress in any situation, while a score of 100 would indicate that the person lives in a constant state of being overwhelmed and unable to deal with his or her circumstances.\n",
    "* __2nd_Heart_Attack__: This attribute exists only in the __training__ data set. It will be our label, the prediction or target attribute. In the training data set, the attribute is set to ‘yes’ for individuals who have suffered second heart attacks, and ‘no’ for those who have not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preparation\n",
    "    using logistic regression as a predictive model, it is extremely important to remember that the ranges for all attributes in the scoring data must be within the ranges for the corresponding attributes in the training data"
