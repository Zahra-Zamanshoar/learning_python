    "\n",
    "## Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "### After completing materials of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain what a neural network is, how it is used and the benefits of using it.\n",
    "* Recognize the necessary format for data in order to perform neural network data mining.\n",
    "* Develop a neural network data mining model using a training data set.\n",
    "* Interpret the model’s outputs and apply them to a scoring data set in order to deploy the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ORGANIZATIONAL UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "    we want to to mine a data set of all current players in the league in order to find those prospects that can bring the most excitement, scoring and defense to the team in order to reach the league championship.\n",
    "#### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Player_Name__: This is the player’s name. In our data preparation phase, we will pop it, since it is not predictive in any way, but is important to keep in our data set so that we can quickly make our recommendations without having to match the data back to the players’ names later.\n",
    "* __Position_ID__: For the sport Juan’s team plays, there are 12 possible positions. Each one is represented as an integer from 0 to 11 in the data sets. \n",
    "* __Shots__: This the total number of shots, or scoring opportunities each player took in their most recent season.\n",
    "* __Makes__: This is the number times the athlete scored when shooting during the most recent season.\n",
    "* __Personal_Points__: This is the number of points the athlete personally scored during the most recent season.\n",
    "* __Total_Points__: This is the total number of points the athlete contributed to scoring in the most recent season. In the sport our team plays, this statistic is recorded for each point an athlete contributes to scoring. In other words, each time an athlete scores a personal point, their total points increase by one, and every time an athlete contributes to a teammate scoring, their total points increase by one as well.\n",
    "* __Assists__: This is a defensive statistic indicating the number of times the athlete helped his team get the ball away from the opposing team during the most recent season. \n",
    "* __Concessions__: This is the number of times the athlete’s play directly caused the opposing team to concede an offensive advantage during the most recent season. \n",
    "* __Blocks__: This is the number of times the athlete directly and independently blocked the opposing team’s shot during the most recent season.\n",
    "* __Block_Assists__: This is the number of times an athlete collaborated with a teammate to block the opposing team’s shot during the most recent season. If recorded as a block assist, two or more players must have been involved. If only one player blocked the shot, it is recorded as a block. Since the playing surface is large and the players are spread out, it is much more likely for an athlete to record a block than for two or more to record block assists.\n",
    "* __Fouls__: This is the number of times, in the most recent season, that the athlete committed a foul. Since fouling the other team gives them an advantage, the lower this number, the better the athlete’s performance for his own team.\n",
    "* __Years_Pro__: In the training data set, this is the number of years the athlete has played at the professional level. In the scoring data set, this is the number of year experience the athlete has, including years as a professional if any, and years in organized, competitive amateur leagues.\n",
    "* __Career_Shots__: This is the same as the Shots attribute, except it is cumulative for the athlete’s entire career. All career attributes are an attempt to assess the person’s ability to perform consistently over time.\n",
    "* __Career_Makes__: This is the same as the Makes attribute, except it is cumulative for the athlete’s entire career.\n",
    "* __Career_PP__: This is the same as the Personal Points attribute, except it is cumulative for the athlete’s entire career.\n",
    "* __Career_TP__: This is the same as the Total Points attribute, except it is cumulative for the athlete’s entire career.\n",
    "* __Career_Assists__: This is the same as the Career Assists attribute, except it is cumulative for the athlete’s entire career.\n",
    "* __Career_Con__: This is the same as the Career Concessions attribute, except it is cumulative for the athlete’s entire career.\n",
    "* __Team_Value__: This is a categorical attribute summarizing the athlete’s value to his team. It is present only in the training data, as it will serve as our label to predict a Team_Value for each observation in the scoring data set. There are four categories:\n",
    "    * __Role Player__: This is an athlete who is good enough to play at the professional level, and may be really good in one area, but is not excellent overall. \n",
    "    * __Contributor__: This is an athlete who contributes across several categories of defense and offense and can be counted on to regularly help the team win.\n",
    "    * __Franchise Player__: This is an athlete whose skills are so broad, strong and consistent that the team will want to hang on to them for a long time. These players are of such a talent level that they can form the foundation of a really good, competitive team.\n",
    "    * __Superstar__: This is that rare individual who gifts are so superior that they make a difference in every game. Most teams in the league will have one such player, but teams with two or three always contend for the league title.\n",
