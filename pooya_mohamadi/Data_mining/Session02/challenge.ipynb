    "## Association Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### After completing materials of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain what association rules are, how they are found and the benefits of using them.\n",
    "* Recognize the necessary format for data in order to create association rules.\n",
    "* Develop an association rule model.\n",
    "* Interpret the rules generated by an association rule model and explain their significance, if any :D\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Association Rules ??\n",
    "   Association rules are a data mining methodology that seeks to find frequent connections between attributes in a data set\n",
    "   * shopping basket analysis\n",
    "   * products purchase frequency\n",
    "   * recommandation systems: items are found to be __associated__ with the item you are looking for, and that association is so frequent in the web site’s data set, that the association might be considered a __rule__. Thus is born the name of this data mining approach: “association rules”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Understanding\n",
    "we want to identify and then try to take advantage of existing connections in our local\n",
    "community to get some work done that will benefit the entire community.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Elapsed_Time__: This is the amount of time each respondent spent completing our survey. It is expressed in decimal minutes (e.g. 4.5 in this attribute would be four minutes, thirty seconds).\n",
    "* __Time_in_Community__: This question on the survey asked the person if they have lived in the area for 0-2 years, 3-9 years, or 10+ years; and is recorded in the data set as Short, Medium, or Long respectively.\n",
    "* __Gender__: The survey respondent’s gender.\n",
    "* __Working__: A yes/no column indicating whether or not the respondent currently has a paid job.\n",
    "* __Age__: The survey respondent’s age in years.\n",
    "* __Family__: A yes/no column indicating whether or not the respondent is currently a member of a family-oriented community organization, such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters, childrens’recreation or sports leagues, genealogy groups, etc.\n",
    "* __Hobbies__: A yes/no column indicating whether or not the respondent is currently a member of a hobby-oriented community organization, such as amateur radio, outdoor recreation, motorcycle or bicycle riding, etc.\n",
